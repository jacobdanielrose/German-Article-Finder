# German Article Finder

A very simple program which takes as input a german noun and attempts to return the correct gender and corresponding article.
Much can be done to improve the current state and if you happen to be aware of a data file mapping german nouns to their genders please 
feel free to send it to me at jacobdanielrose@gmail.com.
